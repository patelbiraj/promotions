Non-winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from Game Number 1456, GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH may be entered throughout the entire Promotion Period for entry into the next available drawing. Winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH cannot be used for entry into a Trucks, Bucks and Trips promotional drawing. </li>
		<li><strong>How to Participate.</strong></li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>To enter a non-winning GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH Scratch-Off lottery ticket into one of the Trucks, Bucks and Trips promotional drawings, a player may use the Florida Lottery's website at  <a href = "http://www.floridalottery.com/">floridalottery.com.</a> or use the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players are to click on the Second Chance tab, select the Trucks, Bucks and Trips Promotion and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. On the App, players may click on either of the Promotions buttons, select the Trucks, Bucks and Trips Promotion and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register if not already logged in. A Promotions button is located on the main menu and also on the bottom navigation bar. Players are to scratch off the coating on the front of the ticket to reveal the 24-digit ticket serial number and enter the entire number in the designated ticket entry area on the website or scan the ticket barcode located under the Scratch-Off ticket coating on the front of the ticket using the App. The 24-digit ticket serial number (4-digit game number and 20-digit ticket number) is located below the play area on the front of a GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH Scratch-Off ticket under the latex covering. Players may enter a qualifying ticket into the Promotion at any time of day during the Promotion Period; however, on occasion, entry capabilities on the website and App may be temporarily unavailable due to routine maintenance or technical difficulties.</li> 
				<li>Any attempt by a player to use more than one account by using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification</li>
				<li>Regardless of whether a player chooses to participate in the Promotion by mobile device or web browser the following provisions shall apply: 
				<ol>
				<li>the player may use the same account login information to enter tickets;</li>
				<li>the player will only be required to register one time; and </li>
			 	<li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms. </li>
				</ol>
				</li>
				<li>A player may earn multiple entries during the entry period; however, each ticket number can only be  entered one time to earn one entry. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries in the drawing. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. Lottery tickets should not be mailed to the Lottery for entry into the drawing. Lottery tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered into the drawing and will not be returned.</li>
                 </ol>
		  <li><strong>Promo Codes.</strong> Various promo codes will be available to players during the Promotion via social media, streaming platforms, websites, gas station TV and emails. A player may earn five (5) additional entries by entering a promo code at the time the player enters a non-winning GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH Scratch-Off ticket number into a drawing. A non-winning GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH Scratch-Off ticket number must be entered to enable the promo code feature, and the ticket number and the promo code must be entered at the same time. Each promo code is only valid for the corresponding entry period for which it is designated and can only be entered one time. However, more than one different promo code may be entered during the corresponding entry period for which it is designated, each with a different non-winning GUY HARVEY $500,000 FLORIDA CASH Scratch-Off ticket number,</li>

Any taxes on the prize in excess of applicable federal income tax withholding requirements are the sole responsibility of the prizewinner.</li>
				<li>The Florida Lottery will provide the grand prize winner a certificate describing the prize and the Ford dealership contact information (which will be based on geography and available inventory) to arrange to take possession of the prize.

The cost of travel to take possession of a truck  prize shall be the responsibility of the prizewinner.
