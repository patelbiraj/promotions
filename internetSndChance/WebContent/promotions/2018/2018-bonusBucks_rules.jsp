        <li>Beginning February 1, 2018, through February 28, 2018, the Florida Lottery will conduct the CASH4LIFE<sup>&reg;</sup> Bonus Bucks Promotion (“Promotion”). Players who purchase a CASH4LIFE<sup>&reg;</sup> ticket of any price point during the Promotion, excluding CASH4LIFE tickets purchased as part of a GROUPER<sup>&reg;</sup> play, will receive an entry voucher with a unique number that can be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a first prize of $1,000 or a second prize of $100 in Florida Lottery “$1,000 A WEEK FOR LIFE” Scratch-Off tickets. </li>
        <li><strong>How to Enter. </strong></li>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>To enter a voucher number into the drawing, players must enter on the Florida Lottery’s website at <a href="http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a>. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players can click on the CASH4LIFE Bonus Bucks Promotion banner(s) and follow the directions.</li>
          <li>The entry voucher will be attached to the bottom of the CASH4LIFE ticket. The voucher entry number is located at the bottom on the front of the voucher. Players are to enter the first 13-digits of the 19-digit voucher entry number. Qualifying CASH4LIFE ticket purchases will produce entry vouchers from the beginning of the promotion period until 10:59 p.m. ET on February 28, 2018. A player will be able to enter his or her voucher numbers beginning at the top of the hour after the CASH4LIFE ticket is purchased. A player entering a voucher number prior to the top of the hour after purchase will be directed to return at a later time to enter his or her voucher number into the drawing. Each valid voucher number may only be used one time, for one entry into the drawing. CASH4LIFE ticket numbers cannot be used for entry into the drawing. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries received. Entry vouchers should not be mailed to the Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Entry vouchers or tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered into the drawing and will not be returned.</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong> Drawings. </strong>One drawing will be conducted by the Florida Lottery on March 2, 2018.  Winners will be randomly selected from entries submitted and received before midnight ET on February 28, 2018.  A total of 120 valid entries will be drawn by the Florida Lottery using a certified random number generation process. The first through twenty-eighth valid entries drawn will each win a first prize of $1,000. The twenty-ninth through one hundredth valid entries drawn will each win a second prize of $100 in Florida Lottery “$1,000 A WEEK FOR LIFE” Scratch-Off tickets. The one hundred first through one hundred twentieth valid entries drawn will be used in the order in which they were drawn and in the order of need to select an alternate first prize winner in the event a first prize winner cannot be awarded.  Alternate entries will not be drawn for second prizes. </li>
