      <ol>
        <li>Beginning June 11, 2018, through August 6, 2018, (Promotional Period) the Florida Lottery will conduct the $400,000 Super GROUPER<sup>&reg;</sup> Second Chance Promotion ("Promotion") in which players who purchase a GROUPER play can enter the free LUCKY MONEY<sup>&trade;</sup> ticket that is issued as a part of the GROUPER play into a drawing for a chance to win a cash prize. </li>
        <li><strong>How to Enter. </strong></li>
       
          <p>To enter a qualifying LUCKY MONEY ticket into one of the drawings, players must enter on the Florida Lottery's website at <a href="http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a>. A qualifying LUCKY MONEY ticket is a LUCKY MONEY ticket that is issued as a free ticket as part of a GROUPER play purchased during the Promotional Period. Both winning and non-winning qualifying LUCKY MONEY tickets may be used to enter the Promotion. Players may enter their qualifying LUCKY MONEY ticket into a drawing beginning on the day after the GROUPER play is purchased. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players can click on the $400,000 Super GROUPER<sup>&reg;</sup> Second Chance Promotion banner and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. The 19-digit ticket number is located near the bottom of the free LUCKY MONEY ticket.  Each valid ticket number may only be entered one time and only into one drawing. Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery for entry into the Promotion. Tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered in a drawing and will not be returned. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries entered. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met.</p> 
        <li><strong>Drawings.</strong> 
		<p>A total of four drawings will be held. Prizewinners for each drawing will be randomly selected from entries submitted and received before midnight ET on the last day of the entry period for that drawing. The entry periods and drawing dates are set forth in the table below. </p>

          <ol type="a">
            <li>The prizewinners in each second chance drawing will be posted on <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a> after the drawing. </li>
            <li>  The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner's registration data no later than one business day after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the prizewinner’s registration data as the prizewinner’s official contact information, including the physical mailing address.  The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a prizewinner if attempts to reach the prizewinner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a prizewinner within two weeks of the date the prizewinners are posted on the website, the prizewinner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate prizewinner in accordance with subsection (3) above. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by email or telephone with the alternate prizewinner within two weeks of the date of notification, the alternate prizewinner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to the next alternate prizewinner. This process will continue until an alternate is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternates due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (6) below. If the Florida Lottery exhausts the list of alternate prizewinners, the prize will not be awarded.
