    <p><strong>53ER22 &ndash; Lotto Bonus Play Promotion.</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Beginning April 11, 2022 and ending May 22, 2022 ("Promotion Period"), the Florida Lottery will conduct the Lotto<sup>&reg;</sup> Bonus Play Promotion ("Promotion"). Players who purchase FLORIDA LOTTO<sup>&reg;</sup> tickets with or without Double Play<sup>&reg;</sup> or EZmatch&trade; during the Promotion Period or redeem a free Lotto ticket prize during the Promotion Period can earn entries into a Promotion Drawing for a chance to win a cash prize of $5,000; $10,000; or $25,000 or gift cards of $1,000 (The Home Depot<sup>&reg;</sup>); $1,000 (Bass Pro Shops<sup>&reg;</sup>); or $500 (Fandango<sup>&reg;</sup>/VUDU<sup>&reg;</sup>). All FLORIDA LOTTO with or without Double Play tickets (winning, non-winning, and free) [collectively "Eligible" ticket(s)] may be used to enter the Promotion. Continuation tickets are excluded and cannot be entered in the Promotion.</li>
		<li><strong>How to Enter.</strong></li>
		<ol type="a">
			<li>To enter an Eligible FLORIDA LOTTO with or without Double Play or EZmatch ticket into a Promotion Drawing, a player may use the Florida Lottery's website at  <a href="http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a> or use the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App").</li>

       		<ol type="1">
				<li>Website. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players are to click on the PROMOTIONS tab, select the Lotto Bonus Play Promotion and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. Players will manually enter the 19-digit ticket number on the ticket entry page to collect entries as described in subsection (3), below.</li> 
				<li>App. On the App, players navigate to the Promotions section of the app, select the Lotto Bonus Play Promotion, and follow the directions. A Promotions button is located on the main menu and on the bottom navigation bar. Players will be prompted to log-in or register if the app does not recognize them as already logged into the Promotions section. Players may scan the barcode on the bottom of a ticket or may manually enter the 19-digit ticket number on the ticket entry page to collect entries as described in subsection (3), below.</li>
				<li>Deleted Accounts. If a player deletes his/her account, whether through the App or on the Florida Lottery's website, all account data, including ticket entries, associated with the email address used to register his/her account will also be deleted. Any entries earned, as described in subsection (3), below, will not be entered into a drawing. A player's account cannot be reactivated using the email associated with the deactivated account. Should a player establish a new account utilizing a different email address, account data, including ticket entries, cannot be transferred to the newly established account. Tickets entered under the prior account cannot be re-entered utilizing the newly created account. </li>
				<li>Regardless of whether a player chooses to participate in the Promotion by using the web browser or the App, the following provisions shall apply:
					<ol type="A">
					  <li>the player must use the same account login information to enter tickets;</li>
					  <li>the player will only be required to register one time; and</li>
					  <li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms.</li>
					</ol>				
				</li>
			  </ol> 
			  <li>Any attempt by a player to use more than one account by using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. In the event a player wins a prize, the name a player uses to register must match the name shown on his/her identification used to make a claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change. A person who has made a legal name change must provide a copy of a marriage certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. Fictious names and business names will not be accepted and shall subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification.  </li>
			  <li>The odds of winning depend on the number of entries in the drawing. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and will be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. </li>
		     <li>Lottery tickets should not be mailed to the Lottery for entry into the drawing. Lottery tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery for entry into the Promotion will not be entered into the drawing and will not be returned. </li>
		</ol>
		<li><strong>How to Earn Entries into the Promotion.</strong></li>
		<ol type="a">
		<li>To earn entries into a Promotion Drawing, a player may enter ticket numbers by scanning the barcode on the bottom of an Eligible ticket using his or her mobile device or by manually entering the 19-digit ticket number on the website or the App. A player may earn multiple entries during an entry period; however, a player can only win one promotion prize per entry. A player may enter a maximum of 200 tickets per day. Each ticket number can only be entered one time and cannot be entered again for either drawing. Training tickets will not be accepted, and tickets with invalid ticket numbers will be disqualified. The hours for ticket entry are between 6:00 a.m. ET and 12:00 midnight ET seven days a week during the Promotion Period. </li>
		<li>Number of Entries Received. For each Eligible ticket, a player will receive the number of draw entries equal to the dollar value of the Eligible ticket entered.</li>
		<li>Promo Codes. Various promo codes providing additional entries will be available during the Promotion Period via GSTV L-Bar (gas station TV), High Impact Digital Units, CTV (Connected TV), and emails to players. Each Promo code earns a player five (5) additional entries into a drawing. Eligible ticket(s) must be entered to enable the promo code feature, and the ticket number and the promo code must be entered at the same time. Each promo code is only valid for the corresponding entry period for which it is designated and can only be entered one time. However, more than one different promo code may be entered during the corresponding entry period for which it is designated, each with a different ticket number. Promo codes available for Entry Period 1 cannot be used, and will not be valid, for Entry Period 2</li>
		</ol>
		<li><strong>Drawings and Number of Prizes.</strong></li>
		
		<p>The Florida Lottery will conduct two drawings in the Promotion to select prizewinners. Prizewinners for the first drawing will be randomly selected from entries submitted and received during the first drawing entry period and before midnight (ET) on May 1, 2022. Prizewinners for the second drawing will be randomly selected from entries submitted and received during the second drawing entry period and before midnight (ET) on May 22, 2022. Entries for the first drawing entry period are not carried over into the second drawing entry period; tickets shall be drawn only from the Eligible ticket entries submitted and received during each drawing entry period. Prizewinners will be randomly selected using a certified random number generation process. The drawing shall be public, held in Tallahassee, Florida, and witnessed by an accountant employed by an independent certified public accounting firm. The drawing dates, entry periods, and winner announcement dates are as follows:</p>

		<li><strong>Prizewinner Notification.</strong></li> 
		
		<p>The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner's registration data no later than one business day after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the prizewinner's registration data as the prizewinner's official contact information. Issuing an email or leaving a telephone message on voicemail, if available, shall constitute notification. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a prizewinner if attempts to reach the prizewinner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a prizewinner within ten calendar days of the date the prizewinners are posted on the Lottery's website, the prizewinner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will select an alternate prizewinner in accordance with subsection (4), above. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by email or telephone with the alternate prizewinner within ten calendar days of the date of notification, the alternate prizewinner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will select the next alternate prizewinner. This process will continue until an alternate is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternates due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (7), below. The Florida Lottery is not responsible or liable for system failures of any sort or type, including, but not exclusively, computer failures, email service failures, telephone failures. If a prize cannot be awarded for any reason, the prize will not be awarded</p>
						
		<li><strong>How to Claim a Prize.</strong><br/>

If the Florida Lottery does not receive the required documents from a prizewinner by the tenth calendar day after notification, the prizewinner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate prizewinner as described in subsection (4), above. The same timeframe for a prizewinner to return required documentation to the Florida Lottery shall apply to an alternate prizewinner. </li>

		<li><strong>Analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt.</strong></li>
		<p>Prior to the award of all cash prizes, a prizewinner will be analyzed for Florida state-owed debt and child support debt. If more than one prize is awarded to the prizewinner, a separate analysis shall occur prior to payment of each prize. If the prizewinner is identified as owing outstanding debt to any state agency or owes child support collected through a court, the debt will be offset in accordance with section 24.115, F.S. If the debt is an amount less than the amount of the cash prize, the balance of the prize less applicable income tax withholding and after the debt is offset shall be awarded. If the debt is an amount greater than any cash prize, the entire prize amount, after applicable income tax withholding, will be applied to the outstanding debt. </p>
