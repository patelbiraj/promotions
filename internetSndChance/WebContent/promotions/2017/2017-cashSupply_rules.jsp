               <p>Players may enter as many times as they wish during the contest period; however, each valid ticket number may only be entered one time. Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Non-winning tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered in the drawing and will not be returned. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries entered. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. </p>  
               <li><strong>Facebook Promo Code</strong>. The Florida Lottery will post one promo code live on Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/floridalottery/">www.facebook.com/floridalottery</a>) each week during each of the three entry periods. Each week, the unique promo code will be fully revealed once the Florida Lottery’s live-stream post reaches a pre-determined engagement threshold. The post will be live on the Florida Lottery’s official Facebook page on Thursdays from noon to 1:30 p.m., ET. If the engagement threshold is not met for a specific week, the promo code will not be fully revealed. The live-stream post will continue to be available on the Florida Lottery’s official Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/floridalottery/">www.facebook.com/floridalottery</a>) after the live event has concluded; however, each promo code is only valid for one week. A player may earn 15 additional entries by entering the promo code (designated for that week) at the time the player enters a non-winning $5,000 A WEEK FOR LIFE, $2,500 A WEEK FOR LIFE, $1,000 A WEEK FOR LIFE, or $500 A WEEK FOR LIFE ticket into a drawing. A player may only enter a promo code once during each week.  </li>
