							Any attempt by a player to use more than one account by using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. If a player wins a prize, the name a player uses to register must match the name shown on his/her identification used to make a claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change. A person who has made a legal name change must provide a copy of a marriage certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. Fictitious names and business names will not be accepted and shall subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification.        
						</li>

							The odds of winning depend on the number of entries submitted and received by the Lottery. All entries are subject to validation by the Lottery and will be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Lottery tickets should not be mailed to the Lottery. Tickets received in the mail by the Lottery for entry into the Bonus Play will not be entered and will not be returned.

				Winner Notification - Drawing Prizes. The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each winner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the winner's registration data within one business day after the winners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the winner's registration data as the winner's official contact information. Issuing an email or leaving a telephone message on voicemail, if available, shall constitute notification. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a winner if attempts to reach the winner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a winner within ten (10) calendar days of the date the winners are posted on the Lottery's website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will select an alternate winner in accordance with subsection (5), above. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by email or telephone with the alternate winner within ten (10) calendar days of the date of notification, the alternate winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will select the next alternate winner. This process will continue until an alternate is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternates due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a winner or an alternate winner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (8), below. The Florida Lottery is not responsible or liable for system failures of any sort or type, including, but not exclusively, computer failures, email service failures, and telephone failures. If a prize cannot be awarded for any reason, the prize will not be awarded; and players will not otherwise be compensated.				</li>

					Analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt - Drawing Prizes. Prior to the award of drawing prizes, winners will be analyzed for child support debt and Florida state-owed debt. If more than one prize is awarded to the winner, a separate analysis shall occur prior to payment of each prize. If the winner is identified as owing outstanding debt to any state agency or owes child support, the debt will be offset in accordance with Section 24.115, Fla. Stat. If the debt is less than the amount of the cash prize, the balance of the prize, less applicable income tax withholding on the full prize amount, and after the debt is offset shall be awarded. If the debt is greater than any cash prize, the entire prize amount, after applicable income tax withholding on the full prize amount, will be applied to the outstanding debt. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Taxes. Except as specifically defined herein, all federal, state, and/or local taxes and/or other costs and fees on all prizes will be the responsibility of winners. For $10,000 and $50,000 prizes, and pursuant to applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Service code, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%) for U. S. citizens and legal U. S. residents. For all drawing prizes, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of thirty percent (30%) for nonresident winners. The reporting and subsequent payment of any additional federal, state, and/or local taxes shall be the responsibility of winners.
