				<li>How To Enter</li>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>To enter an Eligible ticket into a Bonus Play Drawing, a player may use the Florida Lottery's website at floridalottery.com or the 
					Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). </li>
						<ol>
						<li>Website. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players click on the Promotions tab and select the 
						FOR LIFE BONUS PLAY. Players will manually enter the 24-digit ticket number shown on Eligible Week for Life tickets 
						or the 19-digit ticket number on Eligible CASH4LIFE tickets on the ticket entry page to collect entries as described in subsection (3), 
						below.</li>
						<li>App. On the App, players select the FOR LIFE BONUS PLAY under the Promotions section. A Promotions button is located on the main menu 
						and on the bottom navigation bar. Players may scan the barcode on the bottom of a ticket or may manually enter the 24-digit ticket number 
						(Eligible Week for Life tickets) or 19-digit ticket number (Eligible CASH4LIFE tickets) on the ticket entry page to collect entries as described in 
						subsection (3), below.</li>
						<li>Deleted Accounts. If a player deletes his/her account, whether through the App or on the Florida Lottery's website, all account data, 
						including ticket entries, associated with the email address used to register his/her account will also be deleted. Any entries earned will not be 
						entered into a drawing. A player's account cannot be reactivated using the email associated with the deactivated account. Should a player establish 
						a new account utilizing a different email address, account data, including ticket entries, cannot be transferred to the newly established account. 
						Tickets entered under the prior account cannot be re-entered utilizing the newly created account. </li>
						<li>Regardless of whether a player chooses to participate in the Bonus Play by using the web browser or the App, the following provisions shall apply: </li>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>the player must use the same account login information to enter tickets;</li>
							<li>the player will only be required to register one time; and</li>
							<li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms.</li>
						</ol>
					</ol>
					<li>Any attempt by a player to use more than one account by using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other 
					methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. In the event a player wins a prize, the name a player uses to register must 
					match the name shown on his/her identification used to make a claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change. A person who has made a legal name 
					change must provide a copy of a marriage certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. Fictitious names and business names 
					will not be accepted and shall subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification.</li>
					<li>The odds of winning depend on the number of entries in a drawing. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and will be disqualified 
					if eligibility requirements are not met.</li>
					<li>Lottery tickets should not be mailed to the Lottery for entry into a drawing. Tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery for entry into the 
					Bonus Play will not be entered into a drawing and will not be returned.</li>
