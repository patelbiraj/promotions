			<p><strong>53ER24-12 CASH CASTLE Bonus Play Promotion.</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Beginning April 8, 2024, and through May 19, 2024 ("Bonus Play Period"), the Florida Lottery will conduct 
				the CASH CASTLE Bonus Play ("Bonus Play" or "Promotion") in which players can enter winning, non-winning, and free Florida LOTTO<sup>&#174;</sup>, with or without Double Play<sup>&#174;</sup> and/or with or without EZmatch&#8482; , 
				tickets and non-winning GOLD RUSH LEGACY (Game Number 1562) Scratch-Off tickets (collectively "Eligible" ticket/s) purchased or issued during the Bonus Play Period into a drawing for a chance 
				to win a trip to Ireland ("Trip" or "Trip Prize" or "Trip Package"). Canceled and continuation tickets are not eligible.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>To enter an Eligible ticket, a player may use the Florida Lottery's website at floridalottery.com or use the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). 
							<ol>
								<li>Website. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players go to the Promotions tab and select the CASH CASTLE Bonus Play. Players will click on Register/Login and follow the prompts. 
								Players will manually enter the 24-digit ticket number on GOLD RUSH LEGACY tickets and the 19-digit ticket number on Florida LOTTO tickets.</li>
								<li>App. On the App, players go to the Promotions button, located on either the main menu or on the bottom navigation bar, and select the CASH CASTLE Bonus Play. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. 
								Players may scan the barcode on the bottom of a ticket or may manually enter the 24-digit ticket number on GOLD RUSH LEGACY tickets and the 19-digit number on Florida LOTTO tickets.</li>
								<li>Deleted Accounts. If a player deletes his/her account, whether through the App or on the Florida Lottery's website, all account data, including ticket entries, associated with the email address used to register his/her 
								account will also be deleted. A player's account cannot be reactivated using the email associated with the deactivated account. Should a player establish a new account utilizing a different email address, account data, 
								including ticket entries, cannot be transferred to the newly established account. Tickets entered under the prior account cannot be re-entered utilizing the newly created account.</li>
								<li>Regardless of whether a player chooses to participate in the Bonus Play by using the web browser or the App, the following provisions shall apply:
									<ol type="a">
										<li>the player must use the same account login information to enter tickets;</li>
										<li>the player will only be required to register one time; and</li>
										<li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Any player using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. 
						In the event a player wins a prize, the name a player uses to register must match the name shown on his/her identification used to make a claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change.
						 A person who has made a legal name change must provide a copy of a marriage certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. Fictitious names and business names will not be accepted and 
						 shall subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. </li>
						<li>Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery for entry into a drawing. Tickets received in the mail by the Lottery for entry into the Bonus Play will not be entered and will not be returned.</li>
						<li>Players may enter Eligible ticket/s into the Bonus Play at any time during the Bonus Play Period, except that entry capabilities on the website and App will be unavailable from 12 a.m. through 6 a.m. ET 
						due to routine maintenance and may be unavailable at other times if there are technical difficulties. Entries must be made by 11:59:59 p.m. (ET) on the last day of a Drawing Entry Period to be entered into that drawing. 
						See subsection (4) for Drawing Entry Periods.</li>
						<li>Only Eligible tickets purchased or issued and entered during the Bonus Play Period may win a prize. </li>
						<li>A player may enter multiple tickets, up to a maximum of 200 tickets per day. A ticket number may only be entered one time.</li>
						<li>A player can only win one Trip Prize during the Bonus Play. Should a player be drawn as a winner a second, or more, times, that win will be discarded, and an alternate winner chosen, as described in subsection (4), below.</li>
						<li>The odds of winning depend on the number of entries. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met.</li>
					
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Number of Entries Earned.
					For the purposes of this subsection, the term "companion" refers to either a GOLD RUSH LEGACY ticket or a Florida LOTTO ticket; the two ticket types together make a "set." A player will earn two (2) entries into a drawing once the player enters both a non-winning GOLD RUSH LEGACY 
					(Game Number 1562) Scratch-Off ticket and any one Florida LOTTO ticket purchased or issued during the Bonus Play Period. (A player's entry of multiple GOLD RUSH LEGACY or multiple LOTTO tickets will not earn entries into a drawing without also 
					entering Eligible companion ticket/s.) A player is not required to enter both Eligible companion tickets at the same time. If a player enters one of the two companion tickets but not the other companion ticket during a Drawing Entry Period, the 
					player will not earn entries and will not be entered into a drawing. If by the close of a Drawing Entry Period, a player has not entered a "set" of tickets, the ticket/s entered without a companion ticket will be carried over into subsequent 
					Drawing Entry Period/s through the last Drawing Entry Period or until companion ticket/s have been entered. Once a player has entered both Eligible companion tickets, making a set, and earned the two (2) entries into a Drawing Entry Period, the 
					tickets that earned the entries will no longer be carried over into subsequent Drawing Entry Period/s.
				</li>
				<li>Prizes.
					The following table sets forth the prizes available in the Bonus Play:

						<li>In the drawing, a total of 20 valid entries will be drawn using a certified random number generation process. The first ten valid entries drawn will win a Trip Prize.

					<ol type = "a">
						<li>Winners will be posted on floridalottery.com on the Winner Announced dates set forth in the table in subsection (4), above, or as soon thereafter as practical. 
						<li>The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each winner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the Winner's registration data no later than one business day (Monday-Friday) after the winners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website.
						 The Lottery will not attempt to further notify a winner if the attempt to notify him/her by telephone or email is unsuccessful. If the Lottery is unable to have contact with a winner within ten (10) calendar days of
