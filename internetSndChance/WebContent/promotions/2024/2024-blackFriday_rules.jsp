						</li>
						<li>
							The odds of winning depend on the number of entries received during the Promotion Period. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and will be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met.
						</li>
						<li>
							Drawings. The Florida Lottery will conduct one (1) drawing to select winners. Twenty (20) valid entries will be randomly selected from entries submitted and received before midnight (ET) of the Drawing Entry Period end date (December 1, 2024). A certified random number generation process will be used. The drawing shall be public, held in Tallahassee, Florida, and witnessed by an accountant employed by an independent certified public accounting firm. The first ten (10) valid entries will be the initial winners, subject to responding to notification and submittal of required documentation within the timeframes specified in subsections (4) and (5), below. The remaining entries will be alternates and used if winner/s cannot be notified, per subsection (4), below, or fail to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (5), below, or in the event an entry is disqualified. Alternates will be used in the order in which they were drawn.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Winner Notification. The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each winner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the winner's registration data within one business day after the winners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the winner's registration data as the winner's official contact information. Issuing an email or leaving a telephone message on voicemail, if available, shall constitute notification. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a winner if attempts to reach the winner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a winner within ten (10) calendar days of the date the winners are posted on the Lottery's website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will select an alternate winner in accordance with subsection (3), above. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by email or telephone with the alternate winner within ten (10) calendar days of the date of notification, the alternate winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will select the next alternate winner. This process will continue until an alternate is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternates due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a winner or an alternate winner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (5), below. The Florida Lottery is not responsible or liable for system failures of any sort or type, including, but not exclusively, computer failures, email service failures, and telephone failures. If a prize cannot be awarded for any reason, the prize will not be awarded.
				</li>
				<li>
					Submittal of Necessary Documentation to Claim a Drawing Prize

						</li>
						<li>
							The required documents must be received by the Florida Lottery no later than ten (10) calendar days after the Florida Lottery has first notified the winner by telephone (notification by telephone is deemed complete by leaving a voicemail message, if available) or email (issuing an email constitutes notification). If the Florida Lottery does not receive the required documents from a winner by the tenth calendar day after notification, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate winner as described in subsection (3), above. The same timeframe for a winner to return required documentation to the Florida Lottery shall apply to an alternate winner. 
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>				
				<li>
					Award of Drawing Prizes. Upon the Florida Lottery's timely receipt of a winner's required documentation, the Florida Lottery will award the prize to that winner, subject to applicable federal tax withholding and analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt. Prior to the award of drawing prizes, winners will be analyzed for child support debt and Florida state-owed debt. If more than one prize is awarded to the winner, a separate analysis shall occur prior to payment of each prize. If the winner is identified as owing outstanding debt to any state agency or owes child support, the debt will be offset in accordance with Section 24.115, Fla. Stat. If the debt is less than the amount of the cash prize, the balance of the prize, less applicable income tax withholding on the full prize amount, and after the debt is offset shall be awarded. If the debt is greater than any cash prize, the entire prize amount, after applicable income tax withholding on the full prize amount, will be applied to the outstanding debt. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Taxes. Except as specifically defined herein, all federal, state, and/or local taxes and/or other costs and fees on all prizes will be the responsibility of winners. For $5,000 cash prizes, and pursuant to applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Service code, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of thirty percent (30%) for nonresident winners. The reporting and subsequent payment of any additional federal, state, and/or local taxes shall be the responsibility of all winners.
