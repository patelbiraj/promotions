							<ol>
								<li>

									the email address used to register his/her account will also be deleted. Any entries earned will not be entered into a drawing. A player's account cannot be reactivated using the 
									email associated with the deactivated account. Should a player establish a new account utilizing a different email address, account data, including ticket entries, cannot be transferred
									 to the newly established account. Tickets entered under the prior account cannot be re-entered utilizing the newly created account. 
								</li>

										<li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>

							 the player and any associated entries to disqualification. In the event a player wins a prize, the name a player uses to register must match the name shown on his/her
							  identification used to make a claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change. A person who has made a legal name change must provide a copy of a marriage
							   certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. Fictitious names and business names will not be accepted and shall subject the player
							    and any associated entries to disqualification.

						<li>
							The odds of winning depend on the number of entries in a drawing. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and will be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Lottery tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery for entry into a drawing. Lottery tickets received in the mail will not be entered into a drawing and will not be returned.

					Winner Notification - Drawing Prizes. The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each winner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the 
					winner's registration data within one business day after drawing winners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the winner's registration 
					data as the winner's official contact information. Issuing an email or leaving a telephone message on voicemail, if available, shall constitute notification. The Florida Lottery 
					will not attempt to further locate a winner if attempts to reach the winner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone 
					or email with a winner within ten (10) calendar days of the date the winners are posted on the Lottery's website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and 
					the Florida Lottery will select an alternate winner in accordance with subsection (5), above. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by email or telephone with the 
					alternate winner within ten (10) calendar days of the date of notification, the alternate winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will 
					select the next alternate winner. This process will continue until an alternate is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternates due to unsuccessful 
					notification attempts or due to failure by a winner or an alternate winner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (8), below. The Florida Lottery 
					is not responsible or liable for system failures of any sort or type, including, but not exclusively, computer failures, email service failures, and telephone failures. If a prize 
					cannot be awarded for any reason, the prize will not otherwise be awarded.
				</li>

							(notification by telephone is deemed complete by leaving a voicemail message, if available) or email (issuing an email constitutes notification). If the Florida Lottery

							Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate winner as described in subsection (5), above. The same timeframe for a winner to return required documentation to the 
							Florida Lottery shall apply to an alternate winner.

					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Award of Drawing Prizes. Upon the Florida Lottery's timely receipt of a winner's required documentation, the Florida Lottery will award the prize to that winner, subject to applicable
					federal tax withholding and analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt - Drawing Prizes. Prior to the award of drawing prizes, winners will be analyzed for child support debt and Florida state-owed debt. 
					If more than one prize is awarded to a winner, a separate analysis shall occur prior to payment of each prize. If the winner is identified as owing outstanding debt to any state agency 
					or owes child support, the debt will be offset in accordance with Section 24.115, Fla. Stat. If the debt is less than the amount of the cash prize, the balance of the prize, less 
					applicable income tax withholding on the full prize amount, and after the debt is offset shall be awarded. If the debt is greater than any cash prize, the entire prize amount, after 
					applicable income tax withholding on the full prize amount, will be applied to the outstanding debt. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Taxes. Except as specifically defined herein, all federal, state, and/or local taxes and/or other costs and fees on all prizes will be the responsibility of winners. For $20,000 prizes, 
					and pursuant to applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Service code, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%) for U. S. citizens and legal 
					U. S. residents and at a rate of thirty percent (30%) for nonresident winners. For all drawing prizes, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of thirty percent (30%) for nonresident 
					winners. The reporting and subsequent payment of any additional federal, state, and/or local taxes shall be the responsibility of winners.
