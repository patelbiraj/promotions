			<p><strong>53ER24-2024 NASCAR POWERBALL Playoff&#8482; Bonus Play.</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Promotion Period. July 1 through July 31, 2024 (hereafter "Bonus Play Period" or "Promotion Period")
					<ol type="a">
						<li>The Multi-State Lottery Association, on its own behalf and through third-party contractual partners (hereafter collectively or separately referred to as "MUSL" or "Prize Provider"), 
						in conjunction with participating Lotteries, including the Florida Lottery, will conduct the 2024 NASCAR POWERBALL Playoff&#8482; Bonus Play ("Bonus Play" or "Promotion"). 
						Players can enter any Florida-issued POWERBALL<sup>&#174;</sup> ticket purchased during the Promotion Period into a drawing for a chance to become one of fifty (50) Florida Semi-Finalists. 
						The fifty Florida Semi-Finalists will be forwarded to MUSL for a chance to become one of sixteen (16) players, who will then be eliminated through subsequent MUSL-administered 
						drawings to win prizes set forth in subsection (6), below.
						<li>POWERBALL tickets purchased, including those in a Jackpot Combo play, as part of GROUPER Super Sampler, with Power Play<sup>&#174;</sup> and/or Double Play<sup>&#174;</sup>, and both winning and non-winning 
						(collectively "POWERBALL ticket/s"), may be used to enter the Bonus Play. POWERBALL QuickTickets&#8482; and continuation tickets are not eligible. 
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>How to Enter. 
					<ol type="a">
						<li>To enter a POWERBALL ticket, a player may use the Florida Lottery's website at floridalottery.com or use the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). 
							<ol>
								<li>Website. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players go to the Promotions tab and select the NASCAR POWERBALL Playoff. Players will click on Register or Login and follow the prompts. Players will manually enter the 19-digit ticket number shown on POWERBALL tickets.</li>
								<li>App. On the App, players go to the Promotions button, located on either the main menu or on the bottom navigation bar, and select the NASCAR POWERBALL Playoff. Players will be prompted to Register or Login. Players may scan the barcode on the bottom of a ticket or may manually enter the 
								19-digit number shown on POWERBALL tickets.</li>
								<li>Deleted Accounts. If a player deletes his/her account, whether through the App or on the Florida Lottery's website, all account data, including ticket entries, 
								associated with the email address used to register his/her account will also be deleted. A player's account cannot be reactivated using the email associated 
								with the deactivated account. Should a player establish a new account using a different email address, account data, including ticket entries, cannot be 
								transferred to the newly established account. Tickets entered under the prior account cannot be re-entered using the newly created account. 
								<li>Regardless of whether a player chooses to participate in the Bonus Play by using the website or the App, the following provisions shall apply:
									<ol type="a">
										<li>the player must use the same account login information to enter tickets;</li>
										<li>the player will only be required to register once; and</li>
										<li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>  
						<li>Any attempt by a player to use more than one account by using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will 
						subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. In the event a player wins a prize, the name a player uses to register must match the name shown on 
						his/her identification used to make a claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change. A person who has made a legal name change must provide a copy of 
						a marriage certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. Fictitious names and business names will not be accepted and shall subject 
						the player and any associated entries to disqualification. 
						<li>Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery for entry into the drawing. Tickets received in the mail will not be entered and will not be returned.  
						<li>Players may enter POWERBALL tickets at any time of day during the Promotion Period, except that entry capabilities on the website and App will be unavailable from 12 a.m.
						 through 6 a.m., ET due to routine maintenance and may be unavailable at other times if there are technical difficulties. Entries must be made, and received by the Lottery, 
						 by 11:59:59 p.m. (ET) on July 31, 2024 to be entered into the drawing.
						<li>Only POWERBALL tickets purchased in Florida and entered during the Promotion Period are eligible.
						<li>A player may enter multiple tickets, up to a maximum of 200 tickets per day. A ticket number may only be entered once.
						<li>A player can only be named a Semi-Finalist one time. Fifty separate Semi-Finalists will be chosen.
						<li>The odds of becoming a Semi-Finalist depend on the number of valid entries received. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and will be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. 
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>Number of Entries Earned. When a player manually enters a POWERBALL ticket on the website or App or scans the barcode on the App, the player will receive one (1) 
				entry for each $1 value of the ticket. For example, a player would receive ten (10) entries for a ticket price/value of $10.
				</li>
				<li>August 1, 2024 Florida Lottery Semi-Finalist Drawing. One Semi-Finalist drawing will be held by the Lottery on August 1, 2024. Players will be randomly selected from valid entries 
				submitted and received by 11:59:59 p.m. (ET) on July 31, 2024. A total of seventy-five (75) valid entries will be drawn by the Lottery using a certified random number generation 
				process. The first fifty (50) valid entries drawn will be Semi-Finalists and their names submitted to the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). Once a player is drawn as a winner, 
				any remaining entries for that player will be voided. Should two or more entries be drawn that are associated with the same player, the remaining 25 valid entries will be used in the
				order drawn to take the place of any duplicate player so that fifty (50) different and unique players can be submitted to MUSL. The fifty Semi-Finalists will be posted on floridalottery.com and the
 				Lottery's App on August 5, 2024, or as soon thereafter as practical. The drawing will be public, held in Tallahassee, Florida, and witnessed by an accountant employed by an independent certified 
 				public accounting firm. 
				<li>MUSL Drawings. 
					<ol type="a">
						<li>On August 13, 2024, MUSL will conduct a drawing to select sixteen (16) players from among all Semi-Finalists submitted by all participating Lotteries, including the names 
						submitted by the Florida Lottery. No more than one (1) Semi-Finalist from any lottery, including the Florida Lottery, will be chosen to advance to subsequent round/s. 
						No Lottery, including the Florida Lottery, is guaranteed to have a player that is among the sixteen (16) players drawn.
						<li>The August 13, September 12, October 3, and October 17, 2024 drawings will be conducted using the MUSL Digital Draw System. The initial sixteen (16) players will 
						subsequently be eliminated through a series of drawing rounds, as set forth in the table in subsection (6), below. The November 10, 2024 drawing will be conducted using
						 a Mechanical Ball Machine.

				<li>Notification. 
					<ol type = "a">
						<li>Florida Lottery Semi-Finalist Among the Sixteen (16) MUSL-Drawn Players. 
						<ol>
							<li>Should a Florida Lottery Semi-Finalist be among the sixteen (16) players drawn by MUSL, the Florida Lottery will attempt to notify that player by telephone or email 
							using the contact information provided in the player's registration data as soon as practical after MUSL has notified the Florida Lottery. The Florida Lottery deems 
							the player's registration data as his/her official contact information. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further notify a player if the attempt to notify him/her 
							by telephone or email is unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact with the player within five (5) calendar days of the date the MUSL-drawn Florida
							 player's name was provided to the Florida Lottery, the player will forfeit his/her right to be further entered into subsequent MUSL drawings.
							 <li>If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact with the player, the Lottery will promptly notify MUSL. Time permitting, and in accordance with MUSL scheduling, 
							 MUSL may name an alternate, which is not guaranteed to be a Florida Lottery player. Should a Florida Lottery player be named an alternate, the alternate will have 
							 the same time frame as the first player to have contact with the Florida Lottery.  
							 <li>Leaving a voicemail message, if available, and/or issuing an email constitutes notification. The Florida Lottery is not responsible or liable for email failures or faults; 
							 telephone failures or faults; voicemail failures, faults, or unavailability; system, network, or software failures or faults; or the like.  
						 </ol>  
						 <li>Within ten (10) calendar days of contact with the Florida Lottery, the player/alternate must submit, and the Lottery must receive, a completed Winner Claim Form DOL 173-2, 
						 revised 2/2023, or a Spanish Winner Claim Form DOL 173-2S, revised 2/2023; a copy of acceptable identification as set forth in the rule of the Florida Lottery governing payment
						  of prizes; and a completed Winner Release, Acknowledgement, and Authorization form, DOL 474 NASCAR - Winner, effective 7/1/2024. The Lottery's requirement to submit 
						  documentation, as set forth herein, is not an indication or guarantee that the player will become a winner of a NASCAR Championship Weekend&#8482; VIP Trip Prize ("Trip" or 
						  "Trip Prize" or "Prize Package"). If a player has not provided the required documentation within the timeframe set forth above, the player will forfeit his/her right to 
						  claim a Trip Prize, should the player be selected, and the Trip Prize will be forfeited. The player will remain eligible to be entered into subsequent MUSL drawings, 
						  including the final drawing, held on November 10, 2024. A copy of the current prize payment rule can be obtained from the Florida Lottery, Office of the General Counsel, 
						  250 Marriott Drive, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-4011 or at flrules.org. Forms DOL 173-2, DOL 173-2S, and DOL 474 NASCAR - Winner are hereby incorporated by reference and may 
						  be obtained at any Florida Lottery office or by contacting the Florida Lottery, Claims Processing, 250 Marriott Drive, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-4016. Forms DOL 173-2 and

					by telephone or email as soon as practical after MUSL has notified the Florida Lottery. The Lottery will not attempt to further notify a player if attempts to reach him/her by 
					telephone or email are unsuccessful. Leaving a voicemail message, if available, and/or issuing an email constitutes "notification" of a winner. If the Lottery is unable to have 
					contact with the player by October 24, 2024, the player will forfeit his/her right to claim the Trip Prize, and the Trip Prize will be forfeited. The player will remain eligible

						travel insurance, alcoholic beverages (other than those served without charge at any Prize Provider event), incidentals, tips, telephone calls, valet service, internet,

						reserves the right to substitute any portion or elements of the Trip Prize for items of comparable or greater value. Elements of the Trip Prize are subject to availability 
						and may be fulfilled by third-party companies and/or vendors. In the circumstance that certain tours, events, and/or races become unavailable due to scheduling conflicts, 
						delays, acts of nature, or other causes beyond the control of the Prize Provider, the event/tour/race will not be rescheduled or otherwise compensated. Should any 
						tour/event/race be rescheduled outside the Trip dates, the rescheduled tour/event/race is not part of the Trip Prize, and arrangements will not be made for winners to attend.

						behalf of the Guest. No guest changes are permitted past October 24, 2024. Regardless of the date submitted, once names are submitted, any changes made may incur fee/s. 
						DOL 474 NASCAR - Guest is hereby incorporated by reference and may be obtained at any Florida Lottery office or by contacting the Florida Lottery, Claims Processing, 250 
						Marriott Drive, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-4016.
						<li>Time permitting, if a Trip winner is a Florida Lottery player and chooses not to use the Trip Prize or becomes unavailable for any reason, the winner may appoint a 
						Proxy by completing a Proxy Appointment and Acknowledgement form DOL 491-B, revised 2/2023. The Proxy must execute a Proxy Release, Acknowledgement, and Authorization

						also apply to a proxy. Completed Forms DOL 474 NASCAR - Proxy, DOL 491-B, and DOL 474 NASCAR - Guest must be received by the Lottery on or before October 24, 2024. 
						Should all required Proxy and Guest forms not be received by October 24, 2024, the Proxy/Guest will not be permitted to travel. 
						<li>In the event a Proxy is appointed, the original Trip Prize winner will remain eligible, and may win, a cash prize in the final drawing, as set forth in subsection (6),
						 above. Should a Proxy, for any reason, be unable to travel, a Proxy may not appoint another proxy; and the Trip Prize shall be forfeited. In such case, the Trip Prize winner 
						 will remain eligible, and may win, a cash prize in the final drawing. The entire value of the Trip Prize shall remain taxable to the original Trip Prize winner. 
						 Neither the Proxy nor Guest is eligible to win a cash prize. If the Winner/Proxy does not travel, the Guest may not travel alone.
						<li>Prior to finalization of an award of a cash prize, a player must submit a second completed Winner Claim Form DOL 173-2, revised 2/2023, or a Spanish Winner Claim Form DOL 173-2S, 
						revised 2/2023, and a copy of acceptable identification as set forth in the rule of the Florida Lottery governing payment of prizes. Players are also subject to stated-owed debt and

				</ol>
				<li>No substitution of any kind, a cash redemption/substitution/compensation, assignment, or transfer of the Trip Prize, or element thereof, is permitted, except as provided herein. 
				Any canceled/delayed/postponed event and any unused Trip Prize or Trip Prize element/s will be forfeited, will not be redeemable for cash, and will not reduce the Trip Prize value awarded 
				for tax purposes. A substitution initiated by the Prize Provider is at the sole discretion of the Prize Provider. Should there be prize substitutions, such will be of comparable or greater value.    
				<li>Should a Trip Prize be forfeited or not awarded for any reason, it will not otherwise be awarded, nor shall any cash or other compensation be awarded to any player.
				<li>Taxes. 
					<ol type = "a">
							<li>Except as specifically described herein, all/additional federal, state and/or local taxes, or other fees on an awarded Trip Prize, Trip Prize element/s, and a cash 
							prize, shall be the sole responsibility of the winner.

							issuance of payment to the winner. For cash prizes over $5,000.00, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%) for U. S. citizens or 
							legal permanent residents. Regardless of prize amount, federal income taxes will be withheld at a rate of thirty percent (30%) as to a nonresident alien.

							drawing. The entire value of a Trip Prize will remain taxable to the Trip Winner.
					</ol>
				<li>State-Owed Debt and Child Support Owed Analysis. With respect to any $600 or greater cash prize, and after the withholding of applicable federal tax, a Florida Lottery player 
				will be analyzed for state-owed debt and child support. If a player is identified as owing an outstanding debt to any state agency or owes child support collected through a court, 
				the debt will be offset in accordance with section 24.115(4), Florida Statutes. If the debt is an amount less than the amount of a cash prize, the balance of the cash portion after
