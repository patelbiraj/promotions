			</p>
			<ol>

					Game Number 1553, 50X THE CASH; Game Number 1554, 100X THE CASH; and Game Number 1555,

					500X THE CASH tickets will also have chance/s to win Coupon/s for a $100 cash prize. Only 
					non-winning tickets of the afore-mentioned Scratch-off games  may be used [collectively "Eligible ticket(s)"]. 
					Winning tickets cannot be entered.  
				</li>
				<li>How to Enter.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							To enter Eligible tickets into a Promotion Drawing, a player may use the Florida Lottery's website at 
							flalottery.com or the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). 
							<ol>
								<li>
									Website. On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players go to the PROMOTIONS tab, 
									select the Xtreme Cash Bonus Play Promotion and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to 
									log-in or register. Players using the website may manually enter the 24-digit ticket number on the 
									ticket entry page to collect entries as described in subsection (3), below.
								</li>
								<li>
									App. On the App, players go to the Promotions section, select the Xtreme Cash Bonus Play Promotion, 
									and follow the directions. A Promotions button is located on the main menu and on the bottom navigation 
									bar. Players will be prompted to log-in or register if the app does not recognize them as already logged 
									into the Promotions section. Players may scan the barcode on the bottom of a ticket or may manually enter 
									the 24-digit ticket number on the ticket entry page to collect entries as described in subsection (3), below.
								</li>
								<li>
									Manual Ticket Entry. For making manual entries using the website or App, players are to scratch off the coating 
									on the front of their Scratch-Off tickets to reveal the 24-digit ticket serial number (4-digit game number and 20-digit 
									ticket number) and enter the entire number in the designated ticket entry area.
								</li>
								<li>
									Deleted Accounts.  If a player deletes his/her account, whether through the App or on the Florida Lottery's website,
									all account data associated with the email address used to register his/her account will also be deleted. Any entries 
									earned, as described in subsection (3), below, will not be entered into a drawing. A player's account cannot be reactivated 
									using the email associated with the deactivated account.  Should a player establish a new account utilizing a different email 
									address, account data, including ticket entries, cannot be transferred to the newly established account. Tickets entered under 
									the prior account cannot be re-entered utilizing the newly created account.
								</li>
								<li>
									Regardless of whether a player chooses to participate in the Promotion by using the web browser or the App, 
									the following provisions shall apply:
									<ol type="a">
										<li>the player must use the same account login information to enter tickets;</li>
										<li>the player will only be required to register one time; and</li>
										<li>the player's entry history will be cumulative among the entry platforms.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							Any player using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other 
							methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. In the event a player wins a 
							prize, the name a player uses to register must match the name shown on his/her identification used to make a 
							claim, except for a person who has made a legal name change. A person who has made a legal name change must 
							provide a copy of a marriage certificate/judgment/court order, as applicable, as proof of a differing name. 
							Fictitious names and business names will not be accepted and shall subject the player and any associated entries 
							to disqualification.
						</li>
						<li>
							The odds of winning depend on the number of entries in a drawing. All entries are subject to validation by 
							the Florida Lottery and will be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met.
						</li>
						<li>
							Lottery tickets should not be mailed to the Lottery for entry into the drawing. Lottery tickets received in the 
							mail by the Florida Lottery for entry into the Promotion will not be entered into a drawing and will not be returned. 
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>How to Earn Entries into the Promotion.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							To earn entries into a Promotion Drawing, a player may enter ticket numbers by scanning the barcode on the 
							bottom of an Eligible ticket using his or her mobile device or by manually entering the 24-digit ticket number 
							on the website or the App. A player may earn multiple entries during an entry period; however, a player can only 
							win one draw prize per entry. A player may enter a maximum of 200 tickets per day. Each ticket number can only be 
							entered one time and cannot be entered again for another drawing. Training tickets will not be accepted, and tickets 
							with invalid ticket numbers will be disqualified. The hours for ticket entry are between 6:00 a.m. (ET) and midnight 
							(ET) seven days a week during the Promotion Period.

					Prize Winner Notification. The Florida Lottery will notify each winner by telephone or email using the contact information provided 
					in the winner's registration data no later than one business day after the winners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The 
					Florida Lottery deems the winner's registration data as the winner's official contact information. Issuing an email or leaving a telephone 
					message on voicemail, if available, shall constitute notification. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further notify a winner if the 
					attempt to notify the winner by telephone or email was unsuccessful. If a winner does not respond to the Lottery's notification within ten 
					(10) calendar days of the date the winners are posted on the website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the 
					Florida Lottery will select an alternate winner in accordance with subsection (5), above. If the alternate winner does not respond to the 
					Lottery's notification within ten (10) calendar days of the date of notification, the alternate winner will forfeit his or her right to claim 
					the prize and the Florida Lottery will select the next alternate winner. This process will continue until an alternate winner responds to the 
					Lottery's notification or the Lottery has exhausted the list of alternates due to unsuccessful notification or due to failure by a winner or 
					an alternate winner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (8), below. The Florida Lottery is not responsible 
					or liable for system failures of any sort or type, including, but not exclusively, computer failures, email service failures, telephone failures. 
					If a prize cannot be awarded for any reason, the prize will not be awarded.
				</li>
				<li>
					How to Claim a Prize. To claim a prize won in a Promotion drawing, a winner must submit to the Florida Lottery a completed Winner 
					Claim Form DOL-173-2, Revised 2/23, or Spanish Winner Claim Form DOL-173-2S, Revised 2/23, and a copy of acceptable identification 
					as set forth in the rule of the Florida Lottery governing payment of prizes. A copy of the current prize payment rule can be obtained 
					from the Florida Lottery, Office of the General Counsel, 250 Marriott Drive, Tallahassee, Florida 32399-4011 or at flrules.org. The 
					required documents must be received by the Florida Lottery no later than ten (10) calendar days after the Florida Lottery has first 
					notified the winner by telephone (notification by telephone is deemed complete by leaving a voicemail message, if available) or email 
					(issuing an email constitutes notification). If the Florida Lottery does not receive the required documents from a winner by the tenth 
					calendar day after notification, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize 
					to an alternate winner as described in subsection (5), above. The same timeframe for a winner to return required documentation to the Florida 
					Lottery shall apply to an alternate winner. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Payment of Prizes. Upon the Florida Lottery's timely receipt of a winner's required documentation, the Florida Lottery will award 
					the applicable prize for that winner, subject to federal tax withholding and analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt.
				</li>
				<li>
					Analysis for State-Owed Debt and Child Support Debt. Prior to the award of any prize won in a Promotion drawing, a winner will be 
					analyzed for Florida state-owed debt and child support debt. If more than one prize is awarded to the winner, a separate analysis 
					shall occur prior to payment of each prize. If the winner is identified as owing outstanding debt to any state agency or owes child 
					support collected through a court, the debt will be offset in accordance with section 24.115, F.S. If the debt is an amount less than 
					the amount of the cash prize, the balance of the prize less applicable income tax withholding and after the debt is offset shall be 
					awarded. If the debt is an amount greater than any cash prize, the entire prize amount, after applicable income tax withholding, will 
					be applied to the outstanding debt. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Taxes.
					<ol type="a">
						<li>
							Except as specifically defined herein, all federal, state, and/or local taxes and/or other costs and fees on all prizes 
							will be the responsibility of the winner.

							taxes will be withheld at a rate of twenty-four percent (24%) for a U. S. citizen or legal U. S. resident and at a rate 
							of thirty percent (30%) for nonresident prize winner/s. Regardless of prize amount and for all prizes won, federal income 
							taxes will be withheld at a rate of thirty percent (30%) for nonresident prize winners. The reporting and subsequent payment 
							of any additional federal, state, and/or local taxes and any other fees and costs shall be the responsibility of the winner.
