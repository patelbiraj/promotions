		<li><strong>How to Enter.</strong>	
			<ol type="a">
				<li>A player may enter a winning or non-winning qualifying FLORIDA LOTTO Draw game ticket or a non-winning Holiday Scratch-Off lottery ticket on the Florida Lottery's website at <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com/">flalottery.com.</a> or using the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players are to click on the Promotions banner, select the Holiday Bonus Play Promotion and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. On the App, players may click on either of the Promotions buttons, log-in, select the Holiday Bonus Play Promotion and follow the directions. A Promotions button is located on the main menu and also on the bottom navigation bar. A player may only create one account. Any attempt by a player to use more than one account by using multiple or different email addresses, identities, registrations, logins, or any other methods will subject the player and any associated entries to disqualification. </li>
				
				<li>On the ticket entry page, players are to enter the entire FLORIDA LOTTO or Holiday Scratch-Off ticket serial number in the designated ticket entry area on the website or scan the ticket barcode using the App.</li>
				<ol type ='1'>
				<li> For FLORIDA LOTTO Draw Game tickets, the 19-digit ticket serial number is located on the front of the ticket near the bottom. The ticket barcode is also located on the front of the ticket at the bottom.</li>
				<li> For Holiday Scratch-Off tickets, players are to scratch off the latex covering on the front of the ticket to reveal the 24-digit ticket serial number (4-digit game number and 20-digit ticket number) and the ticket barcode. The ticket serial number is located below the play area on the front of the ticket and the ticket barcode is also located on the front of the ticket. </li>
				</ol>
				<li>Entry Determination. Each qualifying FLORIDA LOTTO Draw Game ticket and non-winning Holiday Scratch-Off lottery ticket is assigned a predetermined number of entries. A FLORIDA LOTTO ticket will receive five (5) entries, regardless of the total ticket purchase price. The number of entries for a Holiday Scratch-Off ticket corresponds to the price of the non-winning ticket, as shown in the table below.</li>

		<p> Each valid FLORIDA LOTTO Draw Game ticket and each valid non-winning Holiday Scratch-Off ticket number may only be scanned or entered one time and only into one drawing during the Promotion Period. Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Lottery tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered into a drawing and will not be returned. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries entered. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. </p>
		<li><STRONG>Promo Codes.</STRONG> Various promo codes will be available to players during the Promotion via social media platforms, websites, emails, commercials and TV touchpoints. A player may earn five (5) additional entries by entering a promo code at the time the player enters a qualifying FLORIDA LOTTO Draw Game ticket number or non-winning Holiday Scratch-Off ticket number into a drawing.
