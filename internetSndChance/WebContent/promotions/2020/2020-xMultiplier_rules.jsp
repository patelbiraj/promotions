      <p><strong>53ER20 &ndash; 6 Xtra Chance Promotion.</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Beginning January 13, 2020, and continuing through February 24, 2020, ("Promotion Period") the Florida Lottery will conduct the Xtra Chance Promotion  ("Promotion") in which players can enter non-winning Florida Lottery Scratch-Off tickets (also known as instant tickets) from the following X Multiplier family of games into a second chance drawing for a chance to win a cash prize:</li>
		
       		<ol type="a">
				<li>Game Number 1443, 10X<sup>&reg;</sup>; </li> 
				<li>Game Number 1444, 20X; </li>
				<li>Game Number 1445, 50X; and </li>
				<li>Game Number 1446, 100X.</li>
		     </ol> 
		     <p>Non-winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from the four above-listed X Multiplier family of games may be entered throughout the entire Promotion Period for entry into the next available drawing. Winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from the above-listed X Multiplier family of games cannot be used for entry into an Xtra Chance second chance drawing.</p>
		<li><strong>How to Enter.</strong>	
			<ol type="a">
				<li>To enter a non-winning X Multiplier family Scratch-Off lottery ticket into one of the second chance drawings, players may enter on the Florida Lottery's website at <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com/">flalottery.com.</a> On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players can click on the Second Chance tab and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. The 24-digit ticket serial number (4-digit game number and 20-digit ticket number) is located below the play area on the front of an X Multiplier family Scratch-Off ticket under the latex covering. Players are to scratch off the latex covering to reveal the number and enter the entire 24-digit ticket serial number in the designated ticket entry area on the website.</li>
				
				<li>Entry Determination. Each non-winning X Multiplier family Scratch-Off lottery ticket is assigned a predetermined number of entries that corresponds to the price of the non-winning ticket, as shown in the table below.</li>

	</ol>
		<p>Each valid non-winning ticket number may only be entered one time and only into one drawing during the Promotion Period. Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Non-winning tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered in a drawing and will not be returned. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries entered. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met.</p>
		<li><STRONG>Promo Codes.</STRONG>. Various promo codes will be available to players during the Promotion via social media platforms and websites, and also with the purchase of a $10 or more FLORIDA LOTTO<sup>&reg;</sup>; ticket sold during the Promotion Period. A player may earn additional entries by entering a promo code at the time the player enters a non-winning X MULTIPLIER family Scratch-Off ticket number into a drawing. A non-winning X MULTIPLIER family Scratch-Off ticket number must be entered to enable the promo code feature, and the ticket number and the promo code must be entered at the same time. Promo codes obtained with the purchase of $10 or more FLORIDA LOTTO ticket that are entered with a non-winning X MULTIPLIER family Scratch-Off ticket number will earn 25 extra entries. Promo codes obtained through social media platforms or websites that are entered with a non-winning X MULTIPLIER family Scratch-Off ticket number will earn 20 extra entries. Each promo code is only valid for the corresponding entry period for which it is designated and can only be entered one time. However, more than one different promo code may be entered with a different non-winning X MULTIPLIER family Scratch-Off ticket number during the corresponding entry period for which it is designated.</li>

		<li><strong>Prizewinner Notification.</strong><br/>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>The prizewinners in each second chance drawing will be posted on flalottery.com on the announcement date set forth in the table in subsection (5) above for the related drawing, or as soon thereafter as practicable.</li>
            <li>The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner's registration data no later than one business day (Monday-Friday) after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website.

This process will continue until an alternate prizewinner is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternate prizewinners due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (7) below. If the Florida Lottery exhausts the list of alternate prizewinners, the prize will not be awarded.</li>       
		  </ol>
