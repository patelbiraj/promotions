Winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from the above-listed MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR  family of games cannot be used for entry into a MONOPOLY Bonus second chance drawing. </p>
		<li><strong>How to Enter.</strong>	
			<ol type="a">
				<li>To enter a non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR  family Scratch-Off lottery ticket into one of the MONOPOLY Bonus second chance drawings, a player may enter on the Florida Lottery's website at <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com/">flalottery.com.</a> or using the Florida Lottery's Mobile Convenience App ("App"). On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players are to click on the Promotions banner, select the MONOPOLY Bonus Promotion and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log-in or register. On the App, players may click on either of the Promotions buttons, log-in, select the MONOPOLY Bonus Promotion and follow the directions. A Promotions button is located on the main menu and also on the bottom navigation bar. The 24-digit ticket serial number (4-digit game number and 20-digit ticket number) is located below the play area on the front of a MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off ticket under the latex covering. Players are to scratch off the latex covering to reveal the number and enter the entire 24-digit ticket serial number in the designated ticket entry area on the website or scan the ticket barcode located under the latex covering on the front of the ticket using the App. </li>
				
				<li>Entry Determination. Each non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off lottery ticket is assigned a predetermined number of entries that corresponds to the price of the non-winning ticket, as shown in the table below.  </li>

	</ol>
		<p>Each valid non-winning ticket number may only be entered one time and only into one drawing during the Promotion Period. Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Non-winning tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered in a drawing and will not be returned. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries entered. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. </p>
		<li><STRONG>Promo Codes.</STRONG> Various promo codes will be available to players during the Promotion via social media platforms, websites, emails, commercials and TV touchpoints, and with the purchase of a $10 or more FANTASY 5<sup>&reg;</sup> ticket sold during the Promotion Period. A player may earn additional entries by entering a promo code at the time the player enters a non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off ticket number into a drawing. A non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off ticket number must be entered to enable the promo code feature, and the ticket number and the promo code must be entered at the same time. Promo codes obtained with the purchase of $10 or more FANTASY 5 ticket that are entered with a non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off ticket number will earn 10 extra entries. Promo codes obtained through other means of advertisement that are entered with a non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off ticket number will earn 5 extra entries. Each promo code is only valid for the corresponding entry period for which it is designated and can only be entered one time. However, more than one different promo code may be entered with a different non-winning MONOPOLY BONUS SPECTACULAR family Scratch-Off ticket number during the corresponding entry period for which it is designated.</li>

		<li><strong>Prizewinner Notification.</strong><br/>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>The prizewinners in each second chance drawing will be posted on <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com/">flalottery.com.</a> on the announcement date set forth in the table in subsection (5) above for the related drawing, or as soon thereafter as practicable. </li>
            <li>The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner's registration data no later than one business day (Monday-Friday) after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the winner's registration data as the prizewinner's official contact information, including the physical mailing address. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a prizewinner if attempts to reach the winner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a prizewinner within seven calendar days of the date the prizewinners are posted on the website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate prizewinner in accordance with subsection (5) above.

This process will continue until an alternate prizewinner is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternate prizewinners due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (7) below. If the Florida Lottery exhausts the list of alternate prizewinners, the prize will not be awarded.</li>       
		  </ol>
