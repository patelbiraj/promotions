    <p><strong>53ER19 &ndash; 30 Lotto Cash Second Chance Promotion</strong></p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Beginning April 15, 2019, through May 29, 2019 ("Promotion Period"), the Florida Lottery will conduct the Lotto Cash Second Chance Promotion ("Promotion"). Players who purchase a FLORIDA LOTTO<sup>&reg;</sup> ticket of any price point during the Promotion Period, excluding FLORIDA LOTTO tickets purchased as part of a Jackpot Combo or GROUPER<sup>&reg;</sup> play, will receive an entry voucher with a unique voucher number. Beginning April 22, 2019, voucher numbers can be used to enter into a drawing for a chance to win prizes.</li>
		<li><strong>How to Enter.</strong></li>
       		<ol type="a">
				<li>To enter a voucher number into a drawing, players must enter on the Florida Lottery’s website at  <a href="http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a>. On the home page of the Florida Lottery’s website, players can click on the Lotto Cash Second Chance Promotion banner(s) and follow the directions. </li> 
				<li>The entry voucher will be attached to the bottom of the FLORIDA LOTTO ticket. The voucher entry number is located at the bottom on the front of the voucher. Players are to enter the first 13-digits of the 19-digit voucher entry number. Qualifying FLORIDA LOTTO ticket purchases will produce entry vouchers from the beginning of the Promotion Period until 10:59 p.m. ET on May 29, 2019. A player may enter his or her voucher number for a FLORIDA LOTTO ticket purchased between April 15, 2019, and April 21, 2019, beginnning April 22, 2019. For all tickets purchased on or after April 22, 2019, a player will be able to enter his or her voucher numbers beginning at the top of the hour after the FLORIDA LOTTO ticket is purchased. A player entering a voucher number prior to the top of the hour after purchase will be directed to return at a later time to enter his or her voucher number into a drawing. Each valid voucher number may only be used one time, for one entry into a drawing. FLORIDA LOTTO ticket numbers cannot be used for entry into a drawing. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries received. Entry vouchers should not be mailed to the Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Entry vouchers or tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered into a drawing and will not be returned. Cancelation of a qualifying FLORIDA LOTTO ticket will also cancel the associated entry voucher. Entry voucher numbers associated with a canceled FLORIDA LOTTO ticket that are entered into a second chance drawing will be disqualified.  </li>

            <li> The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner’s registration data no later than one business day (Monday-Friday) after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website.

This process will continue until an alternate prizewinner is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternate prizewinners due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (6) below. If the Florida Lottery exhausts the list of alternate prizewinners, the prize will not be awarded.
