The first valid entry drawn will win the top prize of $30,000. The second and third valid entries drawn will each win a second prize of $10,000. The fourth through seventh valid entries drawn will each win a third prize of $5,000. The eighth through the thirty-seventh valid entries drawn will each win a fourth prize of $1,000.

Drawings shall be public, held in Tallahassee, Florida, and witnessed by an accountant employed by an independent certified public accounting firm.   </p>
        <li><strong>Notification.</strong><br/>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>The prizewinners in each second chance drawing will be posted on <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a> after the drawing. </li>
            <li> The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner’s registration data no later than one business day (Monday-Friday) after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the winner’s registration data as the prizewinner's official contact information, including the physical mailing address. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a prizewinner if attempts to reach the winner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a prizewinner within two weeks of the date the prizewinners are posted on the website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate prizewinner in accordance with subsection (4) above. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by email or telephone with the alternate prizewinner within two weeks of the date of notification, the alternate prizewinner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to the next alternate prizewinner. This process will continue until an alternate prizewinner is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternate prizewinners due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (6) below. If the Florida Lottery exhausts the list of alternate prizewinners, the prize will not be awarded.      
		  </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>How to Claim a Prize.</strong> To claim any prize in a second chance drawing, the prizewinner must submit to the Florida Lottery the original valid non-winning GOLD RUSH Scratch-Off ticket bearing the entry number selected in the drawing.

The required documentation must be received by the Florida Lottery no later than two weeks after the Florida Lottery has made personal contact with the prizewinner.

The same timeframe for a prizewinner to return required documentation to the Florida Lottery shall apply to an alternate prizewinner.

          <li>All prizewinners will be analyzed for state-owed debt.  If a prizewinner is identified as owing an outstanding debt to any state agency or owes child support collected through a court, the debt will be offset in accordance with section 24.115(4), Florida Statutes.
