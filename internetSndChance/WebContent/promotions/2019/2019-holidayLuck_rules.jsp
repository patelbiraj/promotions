        <li>Beginning October 28, 2019, and continuing through January 6, 2020, ("Promotion Period") the Florida Lottery will conduct the Holiday Luck Second Chance Promotion  ("Promotion") in which players can enter non-winning Florida Lottery Scratch-Off tickets (also known as instant tickets) from the following LUCK family of games into a Holiday Luck second chance drawing for a chance to win a cash prize:</li>

		<p>Non-winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from the five above-listed LUCK family of games may be entered throughout the entire Promotion Period for entry into the next available drawing. Winning Scratch-Off lottery tickets from the above-listed LUCK family of games cannot be used for entry into a Holiday Luck second chance drawing. </p>
		<li><strong>How to Enter.</strong></li>
		<ol type ='a'>
		<li>To enter a non-winning LUCK family Scratch-Off lottery ticket into one of the second chance drawings, players must enter on the Florida Lottery's website at <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com/">flalottery.com.</a> On the home page of the Florida Lottery's website, players can click on the Holiday Luck Second Chance Promotion banner and follow the directions. Players will be prompted to log in or register. The 24-digit ticket serial number (4-digit game number and 20-digit ticket number) is located below the play area on the front of a LUCK family Scratch-Off ticket under the latex covering. Players are to scratch off the latex covering to reveal the number and enter the entire 24-digit ticket serial number in the designated ticket entry area on the website. </li>
		<li>Entry Determination. Each non-winning LUCK family Scratch-Off lottery ticket is assigned a predetermined number of entries that corresponds to the price of the non-winning ticket, as shown in the table below.  </li>

		<p>Each valid non-winning ticket number may only be entered one time and only into one drawing during the Promotion Period. Tickets should not be mailed to the Florida Lottery unless players are contacted by the Florida Lottery and requested to do so. Non-winning tickets received in the mail by the Florida Lottery will not be entered in a drawing and will not be returned. The odds of winning depend on the number of entries entered. All entries are subject to validation by the Florida Lottery and may be disqualified if eligibility requirements are not met. </p>
		</ol>
		<li><STRONG>Social Media Promo Code.</STRONG> A player may earn 25 additional entries by entering a social media promo code at the time the player enters a non-winning LUCK family Scratch-Off ticket number into a drawing. A non-winning LUCK family Scratch-Off ticket number must be entered to enable the social media promo code feature and the ticket number and the promo code must be entered at the same time. The Florida Lottery will post one promo code on <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/FloridaLottery/">Facebook</a>, <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/floridalottery/">Instagram</a>, and <a href = "https://twitter.com/floridalottery">Twitter</a> during each of the three entry periods. The unique social media promo code for each entry period can be unveiled by participating in an interactive game; the link for the game will be pinned to the top of the Florida Lottery's Facebook, Instagram and Twitter profile pages. The social media promo code for each entry period is only valid for the corresponding entry period for which it is designated and can only be entered one time.</li>

		<li><strong>Prize Winner Notification.</strong><br/>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>The prizewinners in each second chance drawing will be posted on <a href = "http://www.flalottery.com">flalottery.com</a> on the announcement date set forth in the table in subsection (5) above for the related drawing, or as soon thereafter as practicable. </li>
            <li>The Florida Lottery will attempt to notify each prizewinner by telephone or email using the contact information provided in the prizewinner's registration data no later than one business day (Monday-Friday) after the prizewinners are posted on the Florida Lottery's website. The Florida Lottery deems the winner's registration data as the prizewinner's official contact information, including the physical mailing address. The Florida Lottery will not attempt to further locate a prizewinner if attempts to reach the winner by telephone or email are unsuccessful. If the Florida Lottery is unable to have contact by telephone or email with a prizewinner within seven calendar days of the date the prizewinners are posted on the website, the winner will forfeit his or her right to claim the prize and the Florida Lottery will award the prize to an alternate prizewinner in accordance with subsection (5) above.

This process will continue until an alternate prizewinner is contacted or the Florida Lottery has exhausted the list of alternate prizewinners due to unsuccessful notification attempts or due to failure by a prizewinner or an alternate prizewinner to timely provide required claim documentation as set forth in subsection (7) below. If the Florida Lottery exhausts the list of alternate prizewinners, the prize will not be awarded.   </li>       
		  </ol>
